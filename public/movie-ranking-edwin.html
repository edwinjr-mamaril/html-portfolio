  <h1>The Best Movies According to Edwin</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>Penduko</h3>
  <p>This movie is made from the Philippines starring Matteo Guidicelli as the protagonist. I love this movie because it is filled with extraordinary fight scenes.</p>
  <h3>Johnny English</h3>
  <p>Ever since I was a kid, I have been a fan of Rowan Atkinson. This movie is not only jam-packed with comedy but also with action.</p>
  <h3>Wreck-It Ralph</h3>
  <p>I enjoyed watching this movie because of the cool animation.</p>
